# JavaScript-TDD
## This repo is for Test Driven Development In JavaScript
Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked as many developers considers it an extra workload. Writing
good tests means that your code will be reliable and less brittle as it develops, and any errors
will be identified early on.
